# OOD
The current repository focus deal with NLP 3N(unknown, unclear, unsupport) classification task

# OOD Detection Experiment
PyTorch implementations for papers, include: 
- Dual-Contrastive-Learning-main: 《Dual Contrastive Learning: Text Classification via Label-Aware Data Augmentation》
- GOT-main: 《Energy-based Unknown Intent Detection with Data Manipulation》

##  tips
- 1th paper use contrastive learning to augment text classification.
- 2nd paper use data manipulation to achieve unknown intent detection and data.


## dataset description
### Dual-Contrastive-Learning-main
